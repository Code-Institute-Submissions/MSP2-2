<h1>Aliens Memory Game </h1>    

<h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>

My 2nd milestone project is to test people's memory with 3 different difficulty levels all based on the first 3 Aliens films,
the first level is based on the first film, medium difficulty is based on the second film and the hard difficulty is based on the third film.
Each difficulty starting with Alien the players have a limited amount of moves do complete the game with and ALiens and Alien 3 have less moves to 
try to complete the game. 



<h2>UX:</h2>

The game I made is to help people to try and improve their memory and who are fans of the Aliens films.
There are two buttons to click and change difficulty Aliens is medium and Alien 3 is hard and a reset button to 
reset the board when players have either won or lost the game with a message to letting players know when they have won or lost.
 
<h2>FEATURES:</h2>

The main feautre of this game is the cards which depending on the difficulty/film is choosen has images from the first three films of the main human characters
or different stages of the aliens life cycle. There is the move counter which counts down after each of the cards until 0 is reached and displays a game over 
message with each difficulty have less moves to start with. There is also a win message that is displayed when all cards have been correctly turned over before the move counter reaches 0.
There is also a reset button to restart the whole game from the beginning.

I will be looking to change the reset button to an Aliens 3 design that looks similar to an alien curled up. I may also add addtional difficulty levels based on the further releases
of the Aliens franchise and also may add a serperate button for different themes e.g. Doctor Who, Star Trek, and look at adding a leaderboard and possibly a forum/feedback page. 

<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED:</h2>

The technologies I have used are HTML,CSS, Javascript and JQuery to achieve the results I wanted.

<h2>TESTING:</h2>

I have tested the game at each stage of development as soon as i was able to and everytime I made any changes including little changes from color or word/letter 
change to game board size to see if any bugs had arisen or to make sure the game worked as it should. I did have some interesting bugs when the cards where clicked 
like cards not flipping back over when the wrong pair was showing or cards not flipping at all but i was able to fix this by changing my code slightly or add/removing
code. I have tested the game on browsers and works fine but on IOS phones the cards flip back over noit allowing to see which cards was choosen or allow a pair to be picked 
as such i have disabled mobile gameplay for the moment in order to try and fix this. The games does work on android but the screen flashes with every click of the game i will
also be looking into this bug as well to try and find a fix for this too. I will also be looking at changing the layout of webpage for both browser and mobile/tablets.

<h3>Validators used:</h3>

<h5>W3C CSS Validator</h5>

Check my CSS code with wc3 validator and found no errors.

<h5>W3C HTML validator</h5> 

Unable to check my HTML code on wc3 validator as there seems to be a server error when checking I will continue
to try and rectify any errors should there be any.

<h2>DEPLOYMENT</h2>
I deployed my project with github.

<h3>Acknowledgements:</h3>

I found inspiration for my game from multiple sources online all with different themes and decided to use code sketch for my game,
but decided to use a theme I hadn't seen or at least didn't come across in my research before i started.

I would like to thank my wife for helping me with the theme and pushing me I'd also like to thank my mentor Antonio Rodriguez for his help with some issues i had and
and advising on a few possible ways I could make my game and possible ways to achieve the results I wanted.

I would also like to thank code sketch for the use of there code and avpgalaxy.net for the use of their images.
