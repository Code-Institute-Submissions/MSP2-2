<h1>Aliens Memory Game </h1>    

<h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>

My 2nd milestone project is to test people's memory with 3 different difficulty levels all based on the first 3 Aliens films,
the first level is based on the first film, medium difficulty is based on the second film and the hard difficulty is based on the third film.
Each difficulty starting with Alien the players have a limited amount of moves do complete the game with and ALiens and Alien 3 have less moves to 
try to complete the game. 



<h2>UX:</h2>
The game I made is to help people to try and improve their memory and who are fans of the Aliens films.
There are two buttons to click and change difficulty Aliens is medium and Alien 3 is hard and a reset button to 
reset the board when players have either won or lost the game with a message to letting players know when they have won or lost.
